## 1.0.0 (2020-05-28)

*   Feature: Change `Compressor` and `Decompressor` to use more efficient streaming compression context.
    (#28 by @clue)

    This also fixes any inconsistencies and supports proper error reporting for invalid data.
    Benchmark results suggest this improves both compression and decompression performance by ca. 25%.

*   BC break: Require PHP 7+ with `ext-zlib` during installation and drop legacy PHP and legacy HHVM support.
    (#25, #26 and #28 by @clue)

    We're committed to providing a smooth upgrade path for legacy setups.
    If you need to support legacy PHP versions and legacy HHVM, you may want to
    check out the legacy `v0.2.x` release branch.
    This legacy release branch also provides an installation candidate that does not
    require `ext-zlib` during installation but uses runtime checks instead.
    In this case, you can install this project like this:

    ```bash
    $ composer require "clue/zlib-react:^1.0||^0.2.2"
    ```

*   BC break: Remove deprecated APIs and mark `ZlibFilterStream` as internal only.
    (#27 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite by updating PHPUnit, clean up test suite and
    add `.gitattributes` to exclude dev files from exports.
    (#29 by @clue)

## 0.2.2 (2020-04-20)

*   Feature: Add dedicated `Compressor` and `Decompressor` classes, deprecate `ZlibFilterStream`.
    (#21 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old
    $compressor = Clue\React\Zlib\ZlibFilterStream::createGzipCompressor();

    // new
    $compressor = new Clue\React\Zlib\Compressor(ZLIB_ENCODING_GZIP);
    ```
